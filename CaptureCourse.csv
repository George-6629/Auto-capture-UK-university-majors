The information you provide as part of application will be used by the Fusion CDT for the purposes of processing your application and, if successful, for managing your student career. We may also use aggregated application information to monitor trends in the profile of applicants.
Typically, data will be processed:
-on the grounds of contractual requirement or to take steps to enter into a contract with you e.g. to provide you with a University education;
-because it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (for information on our public task see our function as set out in our charter);
-because you have given us your consent or, in the case of special category data, your explicit consent. 
Your application and supporting docs will be shared with Fusion CDT partner universities Liverpool, Manchester and Durham. The reason for sharing is because we have a joint recruitment process and a joint interview day. Your application may also be shared with other external collaborators, if an external supervisor is involved in a project that you are being considered for.
